Hello! I'm Wilson.

I'm a cute little kiwi drive 'bot, here to help you navigate the typical FRC Java architecture.

Brief file overview:

org.team4213.wilson: The main code package
 - Wilson.java: Entry point for robot code; ties all subsystems together.
 - KiwiDrive.java: Subsystem for the robot drivebase.

org.team4213.lib14: A bunch of convenience classes.

com.kauailabs.nav6: Library to communicate with a Kauai Labs Nav6 Integrated Motion Unit (imu). I'm outfitted with one of these.
